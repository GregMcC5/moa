VII                NEW YORK, MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 1918                    No. 1\nPresident Morgan on the New Year's Outlook\nHead of The Merchants' Association Pledges The Association and Its Members to Patriotic\nCooperation with the Government, for Victory Over the Teutonic Autocracies, and\nwith the New City Administration for the Welfare of the City of New York\n\n\nTo the Members of The Merchants' Association of New York:\nThe year that is to come promises to\nbe one of the most momentous in the\nhistory of the United States. It will\nmake unprecedented demands upon us —\ndemands which I am confident we shall,\neach one of us, meet to the extent of\nour ability.\nBoth in our relationships with other\nnations and in our policies at home, profound changes are taking place. These\nchanges have already been decided upon\nand they are now about to be carried\ninto effect.\nWe are sending to France the first installment of a great fighting force. This\narmy, composed of our young men, represents the abandonment of our traditional policy of isolation and our assumption of a share in the task of making\nthe world safe for democracy, which we\nhold to be the best form of Government\ncompatible with individual freedom and\ninitiative. What new duties this change\nin the foreign policy of the country is\nto lay upon us it is now impossible to\npredict. Our sense of obligation to humanity has compelled us to enter upon\nthis new path and we shall follow without faltering wherever it may lead.\nThe changes which touch each one of\nus more intimately are those that are\ntaking place at home.  We have consented to the abandoment of many\ntime-honored limitations upon the authority of our official representatives and\n\n\nthe extension to new fields of that authority for the duration of the war.\nWe have agreed to new forms of taxation, involving new systems of inquiry\ninto sources of income, in order that the\nexpenses of the war may be met.\nWe have agreed to the governmental\nsupervision and control of the machinery\nof production and distribution so that\nour energies may be concentrated upon\nproduction and transportation that will\nhelp us to win the war.\nThese departures from the beaten\ntrack to which we have so long been accustomed involve the abandonment of\nlandmarks with which we are familiar.\nThey involve also many individual hardships, in some cases extremely difficult\nto bear.\nThe members of The Merchants' Association have hitherto cheerfully made\nall sacrifices that have been asked of\nthem.

Despite the fact that coal receipts at this point have recently been\nmaterially increased by the provision\nof more adequate transportation facilities, no greater quantities of fuel have\nbecome available for use in this City\nlargely by reason of the fact that coal\ndelivered here at tidewater, in place of\nbeing retained to meet the local needs,\nis shipped to New England points under\nexisting priority orders, thereby leaving\nthe people and the industries of this\nCity with less than half the coal absolutely necessary for daily requirements.\n\n\nII\nI\nL\nI\n\n\nY.

New Jersey\nwill contribute a like sum, and a similar appropriation will be needed in 1919.\n\"The recent decision of the Interstate\nCommerce Commission In the New York\nHarbor case,\" Governor Whitman said\nIn his message, \"has brought to the attention of the people of the two States,\n\n\nas never before, the important fact that\nthe Port of New York is historically,\ngeographically and commercially one\nPort, and that any congestion in the\nPort at any point affects the whole Port.\nCoordination Needed\n\"While this Port is. undoubtedly the\ngreatest Port In the world, and Is at\nthis very time performing a war service\nof incalculable value, its facilities have\nnot been properly coordinated. Its size\nand complexity have led to serious and\ngrave situations. The time has come\nto look forward and to plan in advance\nfor the future demands that will be\nmade upon the Port.\nAction Must Be United\n\"Haphazard, piecemeal attempts to\nsolve the terminal problem at the Port\nwill hinder, not hasten, the desired solution. It is the universal opinion of all\nthose who have studied the matter that\nthere must be a careful, scientific study\nof all the conditions at the Port and\na weighing and comparison of the cost\nand value of all suggested improvements.\n\"This cannot be done by any Commission representing either State alone.\nThe task must be a joint task. The New\nYork-New Jersey Port and Harbor Development Commission has already begun this work. With the aid of General\nGeorge W. Goethals as Consulting Engineer, it has laid the foundation of a\n\n\nthat it is considering a proposal for a\ncomplete all-rail belt-line system, with\ntunnels and bridges for the harbor and\nrivers, for delivery of freight cars\nthroughout the Metropolitan District.\nThis belt line Is to connect with all railroads operating within the Port and embracing as integral parts the Brooklyn\nMarginal Railroad, the West Side terminal improvements and the proposed\ninner and outer belt lines in New Jersey.\nMotor trucks for transshipment of\nfreight from outlying railroad yards by\nferries, tunnels under the river or\nbridges spanning them, and a combination of this system with present water\nand rail facilities, are also part of the\nplan now under consideration for developing the Port so as to meet the\nneeds of commerce after the war.\nThe plan further provides for a rearrangement of Harbor facilities and\nfreight movements so as to segregate\ncommodity freight and bring into cl'oser\ncontact ships and freight cars and a lar-.\nger use of modern scientific methods\nof mechanical handling of freight.\nThe Hell Gate Channel\n\n\nMuch disappointment was expressed\nby members of the delegation which\nwent to Washington to ask President\nWilson to order the dredging of the\nHell Gate Channel to a depth of forty, feet instead of thirty-five at the apparent failure of the Federal authorities\nto grasp the situation in all its bearings.\nContracts are now about to be let\n\n\nreally constructive plan.\"'\nBelt Line Under Consideration\nIn its report the Commission says\n\n\n\n",

Slater, of Westchester, is Chairman, a report has been made to the Legislature\nand a bill which will protect the watershed has been introduced.\nProvisions of the Bill\nIn brief, the main provisions of this\nbill are as follows:\nThe lands in Westchester County purchased by the State as sites for the Mohansic State Hospital and the New York\nState Training School for Boys, are withdrawn from those uses and constituted\nthe Mohansic Lake Reservation.\nThe control of this Reservation is vested in a Commission of five members appointed by the Governor.\nThe Commission is authorized to manage and develop the Reservation, establish golf courses, base ball grounds, children's play-grounds and other places of\namusement and recreation, to grant to\nthe Managers of the Society for the\nReformation of Juvenile Delinquents a\npart of the Reservation south of Mohansic Lake for farm purposes, the occupancy not to exceed fifty persons at any\none time, inclusive of inmates, officers\nand employees of the institution, to com\n\nplete some of the buildings for these\nboys from Randall's Island, and to establish a sewerage disposal plant the\neffluent from which shall not be discharged into any stream tributary to the\nwater supply of New York City.\nThe Reservation shall be preserved in\nits natural condition and shall be forever kept open free to all mankind.\nBequests may be made for the purposes of the Reservation, or to increase\nits area.\nThe Commissioners are directed to report to the Legislature and to the State\nComptroller.\nThe Boards of Managers of the Mohansic State Hospital and the New York\nState Training School for Boys are abolished and all of the property in their\ncontrol is turned over to the Mohansic\nReservation Commission.\nAppropriations for the construction of\nthe Hospital and the Training School are\nturned back into the general fund of the\nState after debts have been paid.\nAn appropriation is made for carrying\nout the purposes of the act.\n\n\nof its drinking water.

This bill will\nremove a menace which threatened to\nrender our great City an unsafe place\nfor habitation. The value of such beneficent legislation cannot be too highly\nestimated, for no municipality can afford to risk the lives of its citizens and\nstrangers by supplying them with puifled sewage or poisoned water to drink.\"\n\"The City is to be congratulated upon\nthe outcome. The case was bitterly\nfought by our opponents and I am confident that its influence will extend far\nbeyond the water supply of this City.\nThe Question at Issue\n\"The question at issue was whether or\nnot any method of sewage purification\ncould make sewage a wholesome beverage when mingled with drinking water.\nIn order to establish the principle that\npurified sewage cannot be permitted with\nsafety to flow into a water supply, we\nwere compelled to submit a large volume of evidence and opinion from the\nforemost sanitary experts in the country.\n\n\nApproved by Chairman Hatch\nMr. Edward Hatch, Jr., Chairman of\nThe Association's Committee on Pollution and Sewerage, who conducted the\n\n\nfight for The Association to maintain the\npurity of the Croton water supply, ap-         ecedent Establihed\nproves the bill proposed by the Commit-  \"The final decision, as embodied in\ntee.

It was\ncalled for the purpose of discussing\nmethods which will assure shipyards the\nnecessary number of skilled mechanics\nand decrease the uneconomical shifting\nof workmen from yard to yard.\nThe Most Serious Problem\nIn view of the fact that there is not a!\nsufficient number of skilled shipyard\nworkers in the country to build the\nships required and not enough to form\nthe nucleus around which a skilled\nforce may be developed, this undoubtedly constitutes the greatest single\nproblem of the shipyards at the present\ntime.\nThe Hon.

The Central Employment\nBureau, a labor recruiting organization\nfor all Rochester factories, endeavors to\nprevent other cities from inducing Rochester workmen to leave Rochester. It\nguarantees that the most essential Rochester plants will be furnished with the\nnecessary skilled workmen even if that\nnecessitates a voluntary draft on other\nfactories, and it seeks to make labor conditions in Rochester plants such that the\nworkmen will be properly treated, satisfied and efficient. In other words, Rochester has endeavored to place the entire\ncommunity squarely behind the plants\nworking on war orders.\nUnderlying Idea Approved\nIt was the opinion of most of those\npresent at the conference that the \"Rochester Plan\" is essentially a community\nplan which could not be adopted successfully in a large and complex Metropolitan District, but that the underlying\nidea of the Plan, namely, that of centralized effort to increase the shipyard labor force and to adapt mechanics to\nshipyard work, is possible and desirable.\nThe hope was also expressed that su*W\na centralized body could develop a Siympathetic relation with other lines of in\n\n<L,44\n\n\n1%\n\n\n%-,...\n\n\nter for this purpose, discussed \"The Rochester Plan\" by which the employment\nproblems of war industries of that city\nhave been successfully solved.

I suppose\nit is unnecessary to go into details. I\nwant it understood that I do not attribute the congestion of last Winter and of\nprevious years wholly to the conditions\non the piers.

Mr. J. C.

We\nknow also that the railroads themselves\nhad been constructed for peace times\nand not for conditions of war.\n\"We know that they did not have\nenough locomotives; they did not have\nenough cars; their terminals were not\nextensive enough to meet the strains that\nwere put upon the railroads during the\nlast Winter. We also know that the\nweather conditions were extremely bad.\nAll those things contributed to the con\n\nfreight from the piers and freight stations very substantially and very materially affected the capacity of the country at large to get commerce to New\nYork and through New York.\nPerhaps Hundreds of Millions Involved\n\"I have seen some estimates as to the\neffect of that upon the commerce of the\ncountry. Of course, it is very difficult to\narrive at any definite conclusion, but\nthat it costs the country at large millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions,\nof dollars many people stand ready to admit.\n\"Now, gentlemen, those conditions the\nDirector-General of Railroads has made\nup his mind must not recur during the\ncoming Winter particularly, and perhaps we ought to say that they nmutst niot\nrecur again during the history of this\nCity-the conditions that stopped the\n\n\nHighways Transport Committee of the I gestion that was characteristic of this\n\n\n\n",

The Merchants'\nAssociation, as the largest and most\nrepresentative commercial organization\nin the City, was selected to organize the\nRainbow Division. The Association is\nalready doing a large amount of co-operative work in conjunction with Federal\nOfficials in aid of the successful prose-:\ncution of the war. The success of the\nFourth Liberty Loan is regarded by the\nOfficers of The Association as of the\nhighest importance, and therefore the\nrequest made by the Parade Committee\nthat this Association take charge of an\nimportant part of the parade was granted without hesitation.\nPlans Are Now Under Consideration\nPlans for organizing the parade are\nnow in process of formation and announcements will be made from time\nto time. As the parade is to be held on\nOctober 12 the period of preparation\n\n\nFourth Liberty Loan\nThe Fourth Liberty Loan will dispose of approximately $6,000,000,000\nbonds.\nThe bonds will be dated October\n24, 1918.\nThe rate of interest will be 44 per\ncent.\nThe first coupon will be payable\nApril 15, 1919, and it will be for 173\ndays interest.\nPayments must be made at the rate\nof 10 per cent. of the subscription\nwith the application, 20 per cent. on\nNovember 21, 20 per cent. on December 19, 20 per cent. on January 16,\n1919, and 30 per cent. and interest\non January 30.\nThe bonds will be issued in the following denominations:  $50, $100,\n$500, $1000, $5000 and $10,000;\n$50,000 registered, $100,000 registered.\nThe selling campaign will begin on\nSeptember 28 and close on October\n19.\nwill necessarily be brief. The Officers\nof The Association are confident that the\nbusiness men of the City, and especially\nthe members of The Merchants' Association, will respond loyally and effectively\nas they always have responded to similar\nrequests.\nIn view of the shortness of time, however, they ask prompt responses and an\nalert co-operation from the business men\nwhen the plans are announced and the\nactive work of organization begins.\n\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\nThe Rainbow Division will represent\nthe various trades, or fields of business\nactivity, in the City. Those who take\npart will represent the actual bond buyers of the City.\nThe Military Features\nIn the line of march will be soldiers of\nthe National Army who have participated in the fighting in France, bluejackets\nfrom the Fleet, Red Cross nurses in\nuniform, a contingent from the Naval\nTraining Station at Pelham Bay,\n\"doughboys\" who are being trained in\nthe military camps near the City, airmen, Red Cross workers, engineers, and\nrepresentatives of all the various arms\nof the service.\nMothers of Soldiers\nOne of the conspicuous features of the\nparade will be the presence of the mothers of soldiers who are fighting abroad.\nThey will furnish a powerful appeal for\nthe purchase of Bonds so that the money\nneeded to sustain the troops and uphold.\ntheir efforts on the fighting front may be\nprocured.\nIt is probable that the organization of\nthe Rainbow Division will follow in general the lines which have proved successful in the organization of similar parades\nin the past. The earnest co-operation of\ntrade organizations, and especially of\ntrade papers, is relied upon to make the\nrepresentation in the Division both adequate and comprehensive.\n\n\n\n",

This action was taken by\norder of the Board of Directors after a\ncareful study of the matter had been\nmade by The Association's Committee\non Foreign Trade.\nThe letter sent at that time to the\nPresident suggested and urged him to\ncreate forthwith some appropriate type\nof Advisory Board or Commission for\nthe purpose of collecting and analyzing\nfacts concerning the productive, industrial and distributive business of the\ncountry, to the end that from a knowledge of the basic facts thus secured,\ndefinite policies relating to after-war\nproblems, and particularly after-the-war\ncommercial  relations  with  foreign\ncountries, might be determined.\nThe communication of 1916 also contained suggestions as to an appropriate\nscope for the activities of a Readjustment Commission.\nA communication was also sent in\n\n\nI\n\n\nI\nI.0-                                                              -,%\n\n\nr\n\n\n-Is\n\n\nThe Victory\nAs a special mark of thankfulness\nfor the successful termination of the\nworld war, in which this Nation has\nbeen engaged, the Board of Directors, at their last meeting, preliminary to the consideration of the subjects scheduled for the meeting, unanimously adopted the following minute:\n\n\n^\n\n\n\"The Board of Directors of\nThe Merchants' Association\nof New York, on behalf of itself\nand the whole membership of\nthe organization, takes this\nearliest opportunity officially to\nrecord the feeling of profound\nthankfulness and gratitude\narising from the just and victorious termination of the conflict in which the great majority of the Nations of the world\nhave been engaged.\n\"The ideals for which this\nNation fought have been vindicated.

It had fought\nJ and won its last defensive war, demonstrating with\nfinality its right to national existence, its determination to protect\nthe rights of its citizens.\nIts rapidly increasing people, enterprising, vigorous and successful, were congregating into new communities all over the\neastern portion of its domain, like swarms of eager bees sucking\nthe honey of its illimitable national resources, supplying the\nexpanding needs of towns that sprang up over night, of cities\nthat doubled in a few years. The restless activities of these\nfarmers, merchants, miners, lumbermen, and manufacturers\nwere forming a commercial network that spread from one centre\nto another in radiating lines of communication, each affecting\nevery other, all so surcharged with vital energy that the fresh\ngrowth and interrelations altered the aspect of business and\nfinance year by year.\nThe banks of any given time and place are, of course, an\naccurate expression of the state of business and social evolution\nof that community.

It was intended as an expression both of\nthe regard they bore him personally, and of the pride they took in\nthe glory his writings had reflected on the American name. We\nthought of what we should say in his hearing; in what terms,\nworthy of him and of us, we should speak of the esteem in which\nwe held him, and of the interest we felt in a fame, which had\nalready penetrated to the remotest nook of the earth inhabited by\ncivilized man.\nTo-day we assemble for a sadder purpose: to pay to the dead\nsome part of the honors then intended for the living. We bring\nour offering, but he is not here who should receive it; in his stead\nare vacancy and silence; there is no eye to brighten at our words,\nand no voice to answer. \" It is an empty office that we perform,\"\nsaid Virgil, in his melodious verses, when commemorating the\nvirtues of the young Marcellus, and bidding flowers be strewi,\nwith full hands, over his early grave. We might apply the\nexpression to the present occasion, but it would be true in part\nly. We can no longer do anything for him who is departed,\nbut we may do what will not be without fruit to those who\nremain. It is good to occupy our thoughts with the example of\ngreat talents in conjunction with' great virtues. His genius has\npassed away with'him; but we may learn, from. the history of his\nlife, to empl6y the faculties we possess with useful activity and\nnoble aims; we may copy his magnanimous frankness, his disdain\n\n\n\n"

The appended extracts will give some idea of the varied contents of these\nrecords. To those who may think the l.tbor would be unnecessary, I can only\nquote a sentence from the letter of Governor Dudley of ~Massachusetts, written\nin 1630, to the Countess of Lincoln:\nIf any tax me for wasting paper with rec)rding these small matters, such may consider\nthat small things. in the beginning of natural or politic bodies, are as remarkable as greater\nin bodies full grown.\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\nEDWAMD D.

    "tpg - 00000007": "\nI U LU T H.\nA glance at the map will show, that if nature ever designated any place for\na great city, it is Duluth, Minnesota. Thaddeus Stevens prophesied that,\nat the Western extremity of Lake Superior, would grow up one of the largest,\nif not the largest city on the Western continent. IIe clearly saw, that while\nexterior, sea-port cities lead the column in young nations, inland cities surpass\nthem as those nations advance. London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna and Pekin, all\nteach that ultimately, inland, central cities are the real depositories of the\nwealth, power and influence of a country.\nDIVERSION OF TRADE IMPOSSIBLE.\nThe central business idea of Duluth is, that for all exports and imports of the\nregion West*and Northwest thereof, it is economically nearer the markets of the entire\nworld than any other Lake port. Nearer Quebec, Portland, Boston, New York,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore; nearer Salt Lake City, Sacramento, San Francisco,\nOregon; nearer England, France; nearer Japan, China, India. By \"economically nearer,\" we mean that Duluth is absolutely nearer to many of these\nplaces, and that to all of them, it is commercially nearer, inasmuch as freight\nbetween them, seeking its cheapest channzel, must inevitably flow through it.\nCommerce is the handling of freight. Conveyance of passengers is but an\nincident. Business men follow their goods. Passenger business calls for but\nfew men; freight business for many. The business of tens of thousands of\nsquare miles tributary thereto belongs to it, and can never be diverted from it.\nThis cannot be said of any other city of America. The trade of New Orleans, St. Louis, San Francisco, Chicago, even New York, can be tapped, not\nso, that of Duluth.\nDUL UTH THE G ATE WAY OF THE WTES2' A FIXED FAGCT.\nThe great city of the Lakes must be at the western extremity-the head of\nthe lake system. That is fatal to the hopes of Ashlland, or any other aspirant.\nAshland is not at the head of the lakes, but eighty miles eastward. To\nreach her and overcome that distance, the exports and imports of the west\nand northwest would have to be carried over an additional eighty miles of\nrailroad. That would violate the fundamental idea upon which the prosperity of the great lake city is based-the superior cheapness of water over rail\ntransportation. That forever decides the question against Ashland. Doubtless there will grow up at that point an important city, but like Marquette,\nit will be merely an \"iron city,\" not the water-gate of the northwest.\n\n\n\n"

You know what it is to seek to glorify God amidst the\nturmoil and harassments of contact with men in daily life;\nand you will be able to appreciate the trial and triumph of\nfaith recorded in these pages. The last occasion on which\nthe brave man spoke to his ship's-company-two days before\nhis death, —he urged earnestly and affectionately upon them\nthese words: \"Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit,\nserving the Lord.\"  It was an epitome of his own brief but\nnot inglorious life. And, now that he has left us, does not\nhe seem, each moment, to whisper down into our ear\"; Watch, watch the hour-glass of Time with the eyes\nof an heir of Immortality.'\nMay we have grace to follow him as lie followed Christmanfully and meekly fighting our life's great battle, and\nlooking for \" that day\" when each overcomer shall have his\ncrown I\nUniting with you cordially in this desire, I remain,\nMost truly yours,\nTHE AUTHOR.\nIv]\n\n\n\n"

Having, therefore, no option, and\nasking indulgence for any imperfections which may be discovered in the work, I beg\nleave to submit the accompanying \" Outline Plan of Public Instruction,\" which contains\nthe leading features of a permanent system; to which I have appended a \"provisional\nplan for the gradual introduction of the free school system into the state of Virginia.\"\nThe latter is to be superseded in July, 1871.\nI have purposely avoided introducing unsettled questions into the plans. The main\nfeatures are either such as the constitution requires, or such as have been favorably\ntested by long experience in other states and countries. Doubtful questions have, as far\nas possible, been postponed for future consideration. But there are of necessity introduced a few points of detail, which will be Seen at once to involve questions of policy,\nor of constitutional obligation, on which entire unanimity of sentiment cannot be expected, much as it is to be desired. It will be seen, however, that even these few points\nare practically left unsettled by the provisional plan, which does not ask the legislature to adopt any permanent scheme beyond the plain and imperative requirements of\nthe constitution.\nAs to the general plan, it will be seen that nothing more is contemplated than the\ncreation of a system of elementary education for children and youth, and of normal\nschools for the training of teachers; and for the present, nothing more is proposed to be\ndone than the appointing of officers, and the establishing of one to three schools in each\ncounty, in order that the people of the state may see the operation of the system. In\none sense, the free school system is no longer on trial before us; in another sense, it is\non trial. Great doubts and fears regarding it still exist in many honest and intelligent\nminds, and prejudice has not yet wholly given way. It therefore seems proper, and it\nmay be expected, in undertaking the serious work of introducing this system, that I\nshould give some expression of sentiment in regard to its merits-as I now ask permission to do.\n\n\n\n"

Less pompous and pretentious, more tender and more powerful, with greater\nsweetness and Christian modesty than Montgomery; less lugubrious\nand heavy than Graeme; and less labored, sententious, and didactic\nthan Pollok, Mr. Bickersteth leads us by the hand like his own guide\nOriel.\" - Jorning Advertiser, January 1, 1867.\n\" This is a remarkable poem, and one likely to attract a great deal\nof attention. While antique in form, it is modern in spirit, and is\nanimated by an enthusiasm which carries the reader along without\nany sense of weariness..... In no English poem have we met with\nso perfect an imagination of what the intermediate state might be..... As a poetical vision the picture is perfect..... The ninth,\ntenth, and eleventh books are, to our minds, the best, opening up\nfresh ground, and containing the highest flights of imagination.\"The Imperial Review, January 19, 1867.\n\"The epic narrative begins with an account of the creation of\nangels and men: here he treads the same ground as Milton, treating\nthe subject differently and with great power..... Mr. Bickersteth,\nlike Shelley, is most at home in celestial scenery...... The last four\nbooks are to our mind the best. Their subjects are more untrodden,\nand they are full of bold imagination. As materialized theology in\nits most poetical form, we must give them the highest praise....\nIt is a poem worth reading, worthy of attentive study; full of noble\nthoughts, beautiful diction, and high imagination; and, more than\nall, penetrated with a spirit of holiness which cannot fail to purify\nand sanctify the mind of the reader.\" - The Standard and The Mornz\ninq Herald, January 25, 1867.\n\n\n\n"

IHe will never give up, that is evident, and ir the London-  Iers do not want a Train at full speed running loose in the metropolis, they miust even give him a tramnway.

That defence, as published in the\nGlobe, I propose to review, and leave you to say whether\nit is not an audacious sham which ought to be exposed.\nI am entirely certain that the very eminent and honorable gentleman who conducted the defence fully believed\nthat it was fairly made, and that there was a full,\nhonest, and just exposition of the whole case. But he has\nbeen entirely misled, and Samuel Smith & Co., my clients,\nllave suffered great injustice thereby. The counsel of\nGen. Butler commences his defence of that gold transaction by reading a letter fromn Mr. Rufus Wapples, dated\nMay 12th, 1864. The letter says:-\" As I left the city\n(New Orleans) soonr after the commencement of hostilities,\nand staid in Washington city till.2ay of last year, I cannot speak froom   personal knowledge.\"\nSays Mr. Boutwell, \" I have caused that to be read as\n\"furnishing a basis in evidence for the seizure of the money\n\"in question.\"\nAs the gold was taken a little more than two years before, and as Mr. Wapples admits that he was not in New\nOrleans, but in Washington, and knows nothing whatever\nupon the subject himself, \" that basis in evidence' looks a\nlittle \" shaky.\"  The structure was built two years before\n\"4 the basis\" was laid. The foundation has not eom the\nfirmness of moving sand, it is \" airy nothing.'  A Rruc\nture upon such a base will be likely to tumble, and somebody will \"get hurt\" in the ruins.\nIn the New York Court of Common Pleas the case of\nSamuel Smith & Co., agst. Benjatnin F. Butler, will soon\ncome on before the Court and a jury. Many living wit\n\n\n"

JEFFREY.\n(Read April 15, 1903.)\nINTRODUCTION.\nIN the present and following memoirs, it is my intention to describe certain features\nof the anatomy of the Coniferales which appear to be of interest. The actual state of our\nknowledge of the morphology and history of the group is not sufficient to justify much\ncertainty as to its classification, and consequently additions from any standpoint are likely\nto be of value. The prevailing views as to the relationship of the various orders of the\nConiferales are based almost entirely on reproductive characters, and valuable as these\nmust always be, they constitute, nevertheless, but a single line of evidence. The study\nof the anatomy of the older groups of Gymnosperms has done so much to clear up the\nquestion of their affinities that it does not seem unreasonable to expect that a good deal\nshould be learned from investigations carried out on the same lines in the case of the\nConiferales, the prevailing Gymnosperms of the present day. It is to be anticipated that\nthe results of such investigations will serve to correct and supplement the conclusions\ndrawn from the study of the reproductive organs alone.\nThe existing Sequoias are chosen as the subject of the first memoir, both because\nof their interest as the sole survivors of a genus which once flourished in many species\nthroughout the entire northern hemisphere, and because investigations, already somewhat extensive although as yet incomplete, make it apparent that the genus Sequoia\npresents a striking example of those rare and important forms which so infrequently persist as links of transition between distinct and different natural orders of the present day.\nTHE STEM OF Sequoia gigantea.\nFigure 1, plate 68, illustrates the structure of the wood in Sequoia gigantea as it\nappears in a transverse section of the heart of an old stem. There are three annual rings\nrepresented in the figure.  In contrast to S. sempervirens, to be described later, the\n\n\n1 Harvard Botanical Memoirs.- No. 7.\n\n\n\n"

D.,\nLL.D., Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous\nSystem, and of Electro-Therapeutics, in the Department of\nMedicine and Surgery, died after a brief illness in Baltimore, Md., while on his way to Europe. He was graduated\nfrom the Literary Department in 1872, and from the Medical\nDepartment in I875. He had been connected with the\nMedical Department in various capacities since 1875, and\nhad rendered most valuable service. It is especially due to\nhis labors that the state was led to establish the Psychopathic Ward, which has proved of so great service to patients\nin the incipient stages of insanity, and to alienists in the\nstudy of some of their difficult problems.\nOn June I8th, in the midst of the festivities of Commencement Week, William Harold Payne, Ph.D., LL.D.,\nD.Litt., Professor of the Science and the Art of Teaching,\ndied after a prolonged illness. He was the first to fill such\na chair in an American University. Though when he was\nappointed in I879, not a few educators doubted whether\nsuch a Professorship could be made of practical use, he by\nhis careful study of the problem of preparing college students for the work of the teacher, brought to his task such\nwisdom and good sense and pedagogical skill that criticism\nof the plan was soon silenced, and similar chairs have now\nbeen established in most of the prominent universities of the\ncountry. In 1887 he was chosen by the Trustees of the\nPeabody Educational Fund chancellor of the University of\nNashville and head of the Peabody Normal College. For\n\n\n\n"

R. BROCKWAY,\n\n\nOF DETROIT.\n\n\n\n\nAs in poetry and the fine arts ideality foims\none of the chief constituents of creative genius,\nso in political affairs and civil progress it is an\nessential element. It isthe image of the real,\nthat which may be-not the visionary, the\nfanciful. Plans for improving society deduced\nfrom cloistral meditation may beerical, chim\nbut practical reforms come from actual contact with the classes considered. Tnat prison\nsystem devisea by the philosorher may or\nmay not be practicable, but ttat one induced\nfrom experience is likely to be true, and is the\nideal i wish to evolve.\nThe prison system of a State being a part\nor department of the State government, should\npartake of the same spirit, and since all good\ngovernment is beneficient and promotive of the\nprosperity and haopiness of society at large\nthrough its individual members, a true prison\nsystem wa1l seek this end for that portion of\nsociety for whose   special regard  it is\ncreated.   The   true   interests  of  the\n\n\nindividual are never antagonistic but always\nidentical with, those of society. Whatever\nmay be their character or conduct this is\ntrue. No social ostracism can change it. Disregard of this principle brings disaster in one\nlorm or another. Legalized degradation or\ndestruction of any class or criminal inflicts\ninjury upon the whole social organism directly and reflexively; while efforts for the highest\nand best welfare of any person tor portion of\nsociety promote the general good-positively\nwhen   successful,  negatively  always, and\nnecessarily upon the active agents of such efforts whether successful or not.\nNot only should there be unity of spirit with\nthe general government of the state and prison system, but identity of aim. The grand\naim of government is to protect the people in\nthe exercise of all the liberty they can rightfully claim and secure thus the highest development of their natural facu ties and powers.\nSo the central aim of a trie prisjn system is\n\n\n\n"

The fatal error,'vhicA the retginei s of Mr. Lincoln, supported by Lhe\nmisguided Union-Leagues, committed at Baltimore, by securing his cre-nomination, becomes more patent\nfrom day to day. The unprincipled Lincoln press has never represented the true opinion of the people,\nand at the same time it never has been successful in poisoning it for a lon- period. Truth always will\nshine out; what we said eight months ago in our \"N onthly,\" at a time when Lincoln seemed to be the\ninvincible candidate, is now preached from every liouse-top'rnd at every cross-road in the country\"Abraham Lincoln is unable to save the Republic.\"\nThe only man to whom Lincoln is beholden for this change in plublic opinion is Abraharn Lincoln\nhimself. It is truly said that \" some men are born to greatness and that others have greatness thrust\nupon them.\"  Our present President certainly belongs to the latter class. The cloak of fame which his\nretainers contended to see upon his shoulders, never fitted him; the smutty joker always peeped from\nunderneath, and the nation could only be deceived by him for a very short time. It would be better for\nthe Republic if Lincoln would at last perceive this; but the'sweet custom of governing and the flatteries\nof his creatures have blinded him to such a degree, that besides playing the part of the \" Honest,\" he\nundertakes to usurp the part of the dictator and his \" sic pvolo, sic jubeo\" is heard in trumpet tones\nfrom the White House to the Pacific.\nA Dictatorship commends itself to the respect of even the most energetic nations and in a time of a\ntremendous crisis they suffer, willingly or ullwillingly, violations of the constitution and encroachments\nupon their rights, provided, that such violations and encroachments appear to be indispensable for the\nsalvation of the commonwealth, and that a Man exercises such usurped prerogatives. But Abraham\nLincoln, offending the representatives of the nation, and putting his will in the place.of the will of the\npeople, is but a caricature of a Dictator. There may be no immediate danger in his usurpations; but\n\n\n\n"

I regard it as a distinction of no ordinary\ncharacter, not only on account of the high personal and political standing of the gentlemen who compose this Convention, but because it is a Convention of the people of all\nthe States of this Union [cheers,] and because we cannot doubt that, if its proceedings\nare conducted with harmony and good judgment, it will lead to the most important\nresults. It may be truly said that no body of men has met on this.continent under\nciroumstances so momentous and so delicate since thle yeat 1787-the year when our\nancestors assembled in this city to frame a better government for the States which\nwere parties to the old Conffederation —a government which has beea confirmed and\nmade more enduring, as we trust, by the fearful trials and perils which it has encountered and overcome.

I have not even found, within my experience, that the faculty (or the habit) of closely and carefully observing so much as the faces of men, is a general one\nby any means. The two commonest mistakes in judgment\nthat I suppose to arise from the former default, are, the confounding of shyness with arrogance, and the not understanding that an obstinate nature exists in a perpetual struggle\nwith itself.\nMr. Dombey undergoes no violent internal change, either\nin this book, or in life. A sense of his injustice is within\nhim all along. The more he represses it, the more unjust\nhe necessarily is. Internal shame and external circumstances may bring the contest to the surface in a week, or\na day; but, it has been a contest for years, and is only\nfought out after a long balance of victory.\nYears have elapsed since I dismissed Mr. Dombey. I\nhave not been impatient to offer this critical remark upon\nhim, and I offer it with some confidence.\nI began this book by the lake of Geneva, and went on\nwith it for some months in France. The association between the writing and the place of writing is so curiously\n(21)\n\n\n"

Then it\ncame, with her father and Dr. Sandford; and Daisy was\nlifted in Mr. Randolph's arms and carefully placed on the\nfront seat of the carriage, which she had all to herself.\nHer father and the doctor got in and sat opposite to her;\nand the carriage drove away.\nThe parting with Juanita had been very tenderly affeec\ntionate and had gone very near to Daisy's heart. Not\nchoosing to shew this more than she could help, as usual,\nDaisy at first lay still on the cushions with an exceedingly\nold-fashioned face; it was as demure an I sedate as if the\ngravity of forty years had been over it. But presently\nthe carriage turned the corner into the road to Melbourne;\nDaisy caught sight for a second of the houses and church\nspires of Crum Elbow, that she had not seen for so long.\nA pink flush rose over her face.\n\" What is it, Daisy?\" said Mr. Randolph, who had been\nwatching her.\n\"Papa-it's so nice to see things again!\"\n\"You had a pretty dull time of it at Mrs. Benoit's?\"\nremarked the doctor.\n\" No-O no, I didn't.

Whatever jfucilitates or cheapens the interchange\nof commodities or services - good roads, the locomotive, the steamship or the telegraph — promotes\nabundance, and consequently the aggregate of human comfort and happiness.

DWIGHT.\n1 Vol. 8vo, $3.00.\n\"Mr. Maine's profound work on Ancient Law in its relation to modern ideas.\"John Stuart Mill.\n\" It is history read from the point of law, and law studied by the light of history.\nIt is, consequently, a book that addresses itself as much to the general student as to the\nlawyer.\"- Westminster Review.\n\" It is the work of an accurate and original mind, embodying the results of much\nthought and study, and expressed in singularly terse, clear, intelligible English.\" —\nLondon Quarterly.\n\"Professor Maine is probably the first Englishman who, with any authority, has\napplied the' historical method' to legal subjects so successfully employed abroad; and\nhis prominent example will have a tendency to establish a connection between the\nstudy of the philosophy of law and those branches of philosophical history whose\nfoundation lies in philology and her sister sciences.\"-London Review.\n\" A text book for all English students of jurisprudence. It presents elementary\nideas in a distinct shape; it shows how endless are the ramifications of the history of\njurisprudence which can be followed by learned ingenuity; it handles law in a large\nand free spirit; it clears up points as to which an obscurity prevails in the minds\nof many writers and readers, and it is written with singular clearness.\"-Saturday\nReview.\nSECOND EDITION.\nTHE F(EDERALIST.\nWITH BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\nAND NOTES.\nBY HENRY B. DAWSON.\nPrinted at the Riverside Press, on tinted paper. With Portrait. 1 vol. octavo, 740\npages, in cloth.

It is the only edition to stand on the shelf of a choice library, and is one that\nfew libraries can dispense with. No work more timely than this.\"-New York Historical Magazine.\n\" It will be seen that Mr. Dawson has aimed to furnish the public with an edition\nwhich shall be perfectly satisfactory; and it is evident that he has spared no pains to\n\n\n\n"

This Political\nAuthority is the Sovereignty, and he or they who are possessed of it are the Sovereign.\nIt is evident, from the very act of the Civil or Political Association, that each Citizen subjects himself\nto the Authority of the entire Body, in everything that relates to the coimmon welfare.
